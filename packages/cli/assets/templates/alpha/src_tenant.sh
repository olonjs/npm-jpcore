  Create Cursor rules for persistent AI guidance. Use when you want to create a
  rule, add coding standards, set up project conventions, configure
  file-specific patterns, create RULE.md files, or asks about .cursor/rules/ or
  AGENTS.md.
---
# Creating Cursor Rules

Create project rules in `.cursor/rules/` to provide persistent context for the AI agent.

## Gather Requirements

Before creating a rule, determine:

1. **Purpose**: What should this rule enforce or teach?
2. **Scope**: Should it always apply, or only for specific files?
3. **File patterns**: If file-specific, which glob patterns?

### Inferring from Context

If you have previous conversation context, infer rules from what was discussed. You can create multiple rules if the conversation covers distinct topics or patterns. Don't ask redundant questions if the context already provides the answers.

### Required Questions

If the user hasn't specified scope, ask:
- "Should this rule always apply, or only when working with specific files?"

If they mentioned specific files and haven't provided concrete patterns, ask:
- "Which file patterns should this rule apply to?" (e.g., `**/*.ts`, `backend/**/*.py`)

It's very important that we get clarity on the file patterns.

Use the AskQuestion tool when available to gather this efficiently.

---

## Rule File Format

Rules are `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` with YAML frontmatter:

```
.cursor/rules/
  typescript-standards.mdc
  react-patterns.mdc
  api-conventions.mdc
```

### File Structure

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this rule does
globs: **/*.ts  # File pattern for file-specific rules
alwaysApply: false  # Set to true if rule should always apply
---

# Rule Title

Your rule content here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | What the rule does (shown in rule picker) |
| `globs` | string | File pattern - rule applies when matching files are open |
| `alwaysApply` | boolean | If true, applies to every session |

---

## Rule Configurations

### Always Apply

For universal standards that should apply to every conversation:

```yaml
---
description: Core coding standards for the project
alwaysApply: true
---
```

### Apply to Specific Files

For rules that apply when working with certain file types:

```yaml
---
description: TypeScript conventions for this project
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---
```

---

## Best Practices

### Keep Rules Concise

- **Under 50 lines**: Rules should be concise and to the point
- **One concern per rule**: Split large rules into focused pieces
- **Actionable**: Write like clear internal docs
- **Concrete examples**: Ideally provide concrete examples of how to fix issues

---

## Example Rules

### TypeScript Standards

```markdown
---
description: TypeScript coding standards
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---

# Error Handling

\`\`\`typescript
// ❌ BAD
try {
  await fetchData();
} catch (e) {}

// ✅ GOOD
try {
  await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch', { error: e });
  throw new DataFetchError('Unable to retrieve data', { cause: e });
}
\`\`\`
```

### React Patterns

```markdown
---
description: React component patterns
globs: **/*.tsx
alwaysApply: false
---

# React Patterns

- Use functional components
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic
- Colocate styles with components
```

---

## Checklist

- [ ] File is `.mdc` format in `.cursor/rules/`
- [ ] Frontmatter configured correctly
- [ ] Content under 500 lines
- [ ] Includes concrete examples

# Creating Skills in Cursor

This skill guides you through creating effective Agent Skills for Cursor. Skills are markdown files that teach the agent how to perform specific tasks: reviewing PRs using team standards, generating commit messages in a preferred format, querying database schemas, or any specialized workflow.

## Before You Begin: Gather Requirements

Before creating a skill, gather essential information from the user about:

1. **Purpose and scope**: What specific task or workflow should this skill help with?
2. **Target location**: Should this be a personal skill (~/.cursor/skills/) or project skill (.cursor/skills/)?
3. **Trigger scenarios**: When should the agent automatically apply this skill?
4. **Key domain knowledge**: What specialized information does the agent need that it wouldn't already know?
5. **Output format preferences**: Are there specific templates, formats, or styles required?
6. **Existing patterns**: Are there existing examples or conventions to follow?

### Inferring from Context

If you have previous conversation context, infer the skill from what was discussed. You can create skills based on workflows, patterns, or domain knowledge that emerged in the conversation.

### Gathering Additional Information

If you need clarification, use the AskQuestion tool when available:

```
Example AskQuestion usage:
- "Where should this skill be stored?" with options like ["Personal (~/.cursor/skills/)", "Project (.cursor/skills/)"]
- "Should this skill include executable scripts?" with options like ["Yes", "No"]
```

If the AskQuestion tool is not available, ask these questions conversationally.

---

## Skill File Structure

### Directory Layout

Skills are stored as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required - main instructions
├── reference.md          # Optional - detailed documentation
├── examples.md           # Optional - usage examples
└── scripts/              # Optional - utility scripts
    ├── validate.py
    └── helper.sh
```

### Storage Locations

| Type | Path | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| Personal | ~/.cursor/skills/skill-name/ | Available across all your projects |
| Project | .cursor/skills/skill-name/ | Shared with anyone using the repository |

**IMPORTANT**: Never create skills in `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/`. This directory is reserved for Cursor's internal built-in skills and is managed automatically by the system.

### SKILL.md Structure

Every skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown body:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions
Clear, step-by-step guidance for the agent.

## Examples
Concrete examples of using this skill.
```

### Required Metadata Fields

| Field | Requirements | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `name` | Max 64 chars, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only | Unique identifier for the skill |
| `description` | Max 1024 chars, non-empty | Helps agent decide when to apply the skill |

---

## Writing Effective Descriptions

The description is **critical** for skill discovery. The agent uses it to decide when to apply your skill.

### Description Best Practices

1. **Write in third person** (the description is injected into the system prompt):
   - ✅ Good: "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
   - ❌ Avoid: "I can help you process Excel files"
   - ❌ Avoid: "You can use this to process Excel files"

2. **Be specific and include trigger terms**:
   - ✅ Good: "Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction."
   - ❌ Vague: "Helps with documents"

3. **Include both WHAT and WHEN**:
   - WHAT: What the skill does (specific capabilities)
   - WHEN: When the agent should use it (trigger scenarios)

### Description Examples

```yaml
# PDF Processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.

# Excel Analysis
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.

# Git Commit Helper
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.

# Code Review
description: Review code for quality, security, and best practices following team standards. Use when reviewing pull requests, code changes, or when the user asks for a code review.
```

---

## Core Authoring Principles

### 1. Concise is Key

The context window is shared with conversation history, other skills, and requests. Every token competes for space.

**Default assumption**: The agent is already very smart. Only add context it doesn't already have.

Challenge each piece of information:
- "Does the agent really need this explanation?"
- "Can I assume the agent knows this?"
- "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good (concise)**:
```markdown
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

\`\`\`python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
\`\`\`
```

**Bad (verbose)**:
```markdown
## Extract PDF text

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains
text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to
use a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we
recommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well...
```

### 2. Keep SKILL.md Under 500 Lines

For optimal performance, the main SKILL.md file should be concise. Use progressive disclosure for detailed content.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Put essential information in SKILL.md; detailed reference material in separate files that the agent reads only when needed.

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start
[Essential instructions here]

## Additional resources
- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)
```

**Keep references one level deep** - link directly from SKILL.md to reference files. Deeply nested references may result in partial reads.

### 4. Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to the task's fragility:

| Freedom Level | When to Use | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **High** (text instructions) | Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent | Code review guidelines |
| **Medium** (pseudocode/templates) | Preferred pattern with acceptable variation | Report generation |
| **Low** (specific scripts) | Fragile operations, consistency critical | Database migrations |

---

## Common Patterns

### Template Pattern

Provide output format templates:

```markdown
## Report structure

Use this template:

\`\`\`markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data

## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
\`\`\`
```

### Examples Pattern

For skills where output quality depends on seeing examples:

```markdown
## Commit message format

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
\`\`\`
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware
\`\`\`

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly
Output:
\`\`\`
fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation
\`\`\`
```

### Workflow Pattern

Break complex operations into clear steps with checklists:

```markdown
## Form filling workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

\`\`\`
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form
- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping
- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping
- [ ] Step 4: Fill the form
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output
\`\`\`

**Step 1: Analyze the form**
Run: \`python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf\`
...
```

### Conditional Workflow Pattern

Guide through decision points:

```markdown
## Document modification workflow

1. Determine the modification type:

   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow:
   - Use docx-js library
   - Build document from scratch
   ...
```

### Feedback Loop Pattern

For quality-critical tasks, implement validation loops:

```markdown
## Document editing process

1. Make your edits
2. **Validate immediately**: \`python scripts/validate.py output/\`
3. If validation fails:
   - Review the error message
   - Fix the issues
   - Run validation again
4. **Only proceed when validation passes**
```

---

## Utility Scripts

Pre-made scripts offer advantages over generated code:
- More reliable than generated code
- Save tokens (no code in context)
- Save time (no code generation)
- Ensure consistency across uses

```markdown
## Utility scripts

**analyze_form.py**: Extract all form fields from PDF
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf > fields.json
\`\`\`

**validate.py**: Check for errors
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/validate.py fields.json
# Returns: "OK" or lists conflicts
\`\`\`
```

Make clear whether the agent should **execute** the script (most common) or **read** it as reference.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Windows-Style Paths
- ✅ Use: `scripts/helper.py`
- ❌ Avoid: `scripts\helper.py`

### 2. Too Many Options
```markdown
# Bad - confusing
"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or..."

# Good - provide a default with escape hatch
"Use pdfplumber for text extraction.
For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead."
```

### 3. Time-Sensitive Information
```markdown
# Bad - will become outdated
"If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API."

# Good - use an "old patterns" section
## Current method
Use the v2 API endpoint.

## Old patterns (deprecated)
<details>
<summary>Legacy v1 API</summary>
...
</details>
```

### 4. Inconsistent Terminology
Choose one term and use it throughout:
- ✅ Always "API endpoint" (not mixing "URL", "route", "path")
- ✅ Always "field" (not mixing "box", "element", "control")

### 5. Vague Skill Names
- ✅ Good: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`
- ❌ Avoid: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`

---

## Skill Creation Workflow

When helping a user create a skill, follow this process:

### Phase 1: Discovery

Gather information about:
1. The skill's purpose and primary use case
2. Storage location (personal vs project)
3. Trigger scenarios
4. Any specific requirements or constraints
5. Existing examples or patterns to follow

If you have access to the AskQuestion tool, use it for efficient structured gathering. Otherwise, ask conversationally.

### Phase 2: Design

1. Draft the skill name (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)
2. Write a specific, third-person description
3. Outline the main sections needed
4. Identify if supporting files or scripts are needed

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Create the directory structure
2. Write the SKILL.md file with frontmatter
3. Create any supporting reference files
4. Create any utility scripts if needed

### Phase 4: Verification

1. Verify the SKILL.md is under 500 lines
2. Check that the description is specific and includes trigger terms
3. Ensure consistent terminology throughout
4. Verify all file references are one level deep
5. Test that the skill can be discovered and applied

---

# Creating Custom Subagents

This skill guides you through creating custom subagents for Cursor. Subagents are specialized AI assistants that run in isolated contexts with custom system prompts.

## When to Use Subagents

Subagents help you:
- **Preserve context** by isolating exploration from your main conversation
- **Specialize behavior** with focused system prompts for specific domains
- **Reuse configurations** across projects with user-level subagents

### Inferring from Context

If you have previous conversation context, infer the subagent's purpose and behavior from what was discussed. Create the subagent based on specialized tasks or workflows that emerged in the conversation.

## Subagent Locations

| Location | Scope | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `.cursor/agents/` | Current project | Higher |
| `~/.cursor/agents/` | All your projects | Lower |

When multiple subagents share the same name, the higher-priority location wins.

**Project subagents** (`.cursor/agents/`): Ideal for codebase-specific agents. Check into version control to share with your team.

**User subagents** (`~/.cursor/agents/`): Personal agents available across all your projects.

## Subagent File Format

Create a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a markdown body (the system prompt):

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
---

You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze the code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique identifier (lowercase letters and hyphens only) |
| `description` | When to delegate to this subagent (be specific!) |

## Writing Effective Descriptions

The description is **critical** - the AI uses it to decide when to delegate.

```yaml
# ❌ Too vague
description: Helps with code

# ✅ Specific and actionable
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
```

Include "use proactively" to encourage automatic delegation.

## Example Subagents

### Code Reviewer

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.

When invoked:
1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:
- Code is clear and readable
- Functions and variables are well-named
- No duplicated code
- Proper error handling
- No exposed secrets or API keys
- Input validation implemented
- Good test coverage
- Performance considerations addressed

Provide feedback organized by priority:
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)
- Suggestions (consider improving)

Include specific examples of how to fix issues.
```

### Debugger

```markdown
---
name: debugger
description: Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior. Use proactively when encountering any issues.
---

You are an expert debugger specializing in root cause analysis.

When invoked:
1. Capture error message and stack trace
2. Identify reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location
4. Implement minimal fix
5. Verify solution works

Debugging process:
- Analyze error messages and logs
- Check recent code changes
- Form and test hypotheses
- Add strategic debug logging
- Inspect variable states

For each issue, provide:
- Root cause explanation
- Evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Specific code fix
- Testing approach
- Prevention recommendations

Focus on fixing the underlying issue, not the symptoms.
```

### Data Scientist

```markdown
---
name: data-scientist
description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
---

You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

When invoked:
1. Understand the data analysis requirement
2. Write efficient SQL queries
3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
4. Analyze and summarize results
5. Present findings clearly

Key practices:
- Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
- Use appropriate aggregations and joins
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Format results for readability
- Provide data-driven recommendations

For each analysis:
- Explain the query approach
- Document any assumptions
- Highlight key findings
- Suggest next steps based on data

Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.
```

## Subagent Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Decide the Scope

- **Project-level** (`.cursor/agents/`): For codebase-specific agents shared with team
- **User-level** (`~/.cursor/agents/`): For personal agents across all projects

### Step 2: Create the File

```bash
# For project-level
mkdir -p .cursor/agents
touch .cursor/agents/my-agent.md

# For user-level
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/agents
touch ~/.cursor/agents/my-agent.md
```

### Step 3: Define Configuration

Write the frontmatter with the required fields (`name` and `description`).

### Step 4: Write the System Prompt

The body becomes the system prompt. Be specific about:
- What the agent should do when invoked
- The workflow or process to follow
- Output format and structure
- Any constraints or guidelines

### Step 5: Test the Agent

Ask the AI to use your new agent:

```
Use the my-agent subagent to [task description]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Design focused subagents**: Each should excel at one specific task
2. **Write detailed descriptions**: Include trigger terms so the AI knows when to delegate
3. **Check into version control**: Share project subagents with your team
4. **Use proactive language**: Include "use proactively" in descriptions

## Troubleshooting

### Subagent Not Found
- Ensure file is in `.cursor/agents/` or `~/.cursor/agents/`
- Check file has `.md` extension
- Verify YAML frontmatter syntax is valid

description: Use when working on a JsonPages tenant, transforming the base tenant DNA into a branded tenant, adding or modifying tenant sections, maintaining schema-driven editability, or reasoning about what belongs to @jsonpages/core versus the tenant.
---

# JsonPages Tenant

Use this skill for work on the JsonPages ecosystem when the task involves:

- a tenant generated from the JsonPages CLI
- `@jsonpages/core`
- tenant sections/capsules
- `src/data/pages/**/*.json` or `src/data/config/*.json`
- schema-driven editing and inspector compatibility
- generator scripts that turn a base tenant into a branded tenant

Read code first. Treat documents as secondary unless they help interpret code that is otherwise ambiguous.

## Core Model

JsonPages has a hard split between `core` and `tenant`.

- `@jsonpages/core` owns routing, `/admin`, `/admin/preview`, preview stage, studio state, inspector/form factory, and shared engine behavior.
- The tenant owns sections, schemas, type augmentation, page/config JSON, theme/design layer, and local workflow scripts.
- The tenant does not implement the CMS. It implements the tenant protocol consumed by the engine.

In this ecosystem, code is the source of truth.

Compliance priority:

1. Data is bound correctly.
2. Schemas describe fields correctly.
3. Content is editable without breaking the inspector.
4. Tenant structure stays standardized.
5. Context-aware focus/highlight in the legacy admin is desirable but secondary.

## Canonical References

Use these local references when available:

- Base tenant DNA: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\temp\alpha`
- Custom tenant reference: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\temp\gptgiorgio`
- Core engine: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\npm-jpcore\packages\core`
- Generator example: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\temp\clonark\generate_olon.sh`

If these paths are missing, infer the same roles from the current workspace:

- base CLI-generated tenant
- branded tenant
- core package
- generator script

## Tenant Anatomy

Expect these files to move together:

- `src/components/<section>/View.tsx`
- `src/components/<section>/schema.ts`
- `src/components/<section>/types.ts`
- `src/components/<section>/index.ts`
- `src/lib/ComponentRegistry.tsx`
- `src/lib/schemas.ts`
- `src/lib/addSectionConfig.ts`
- `src/types.ts`
- `src/data/pages/**/*.json`
- `src/data/config/site.json`
- `src/data/config/theme.json`
- `src/data/config/menu.json`

Useful rule: if a section type changes, check all of the files above before concluding the task is done.

## What Good Work Looks Like

A good tenant change:

- stays inside tenant boundaries unless the issue is truly in `@jsonpages/core`
- keeps schema, defaults, registry, and type augmentation aligned
- preserves editability for strings, lists, nested objects, CTAs, and image fields
- uses `ImageSelectionSchema`-style image fields when the content is image-driven
- keeps page content JSON-first

A suspicious tenant change:

- patches the core to fix a tenant modeling problem
- adds visual complexity without data bindings
- introduces fields into JSON that are not represented in schema
- changes a section view without updating defaults or types
- optimizes legacy context awareness at the expense of simpler, reliable editability

## Workflow 1: Base Tenant -> Branded Tenant

This is the primary workflow.

Goal:

- transform a CLI-generated base tenant into a branded tenant through a single generator script

Treat the generator script as procedural source of truth for the green build workflow.

When maintaining or authoring a generator:

1. Separate non-deterministic bootstrap from deterministic sync.
2. Make explicit which files are managed output.
3. Keep the script aligned with the current tenant code, not with stale docs.
4. Preserve tenant protocol files: sections, schemas, registries, type augmentation, config JSON, assets, shims.
5. Prefer deterministic local writes after any remote/bootstrap step.

Typical structure of a good generator:

- preflight checks
- remote/bootstrap steps such as `shadcn` or external registries
- deterministic creation/sync of tenant files
- compatibility patches for known unstable upstream payloads
- final validation commands

When asked to update a branded tenant generator:

1. Diff base tenant against branded tenant.
2. Classify differences into:
   - intended branded output
   - reusable generator logic
   - accidental drift
3. Encode only the reusable intended differences into the script.
4. Keep the output reproducible from a fresh base tenant.

## Workflow 2: Add Or Change A Section

When adding a new section type:

1. Create `View.tsx`, `schema.ts`, `types.ts`, `index.ts`.
2. Register the section in `src/lib/ComponentRegistry.tsx`.
3. Register the schema in `src/lib/schemas.ts`.
4. Add defaults and label in `src/lib/addSectionConfig.ts`.
5. Extend `SectionComponentPropsMap` and module augmentation in `src/types.ts`.
6. Add or update page JSON using the new section type.

When changing an existing section:

1. Read the section schema first.
2. Read the page JSON using it.
3. Check the view for `data-jp-field` usage and binding shape.
4. Update defaults if the data shape changed.
5. Verify the inspector still has a path to edit the content.

## Workflow 3: Images, Rich Content, Nested Routes

Images:

- Prefer structured image objects compatible with tenant base schemas.
- Assume the core supports image picking and upload flows.
- The tenant is responsible for declaring image fields in schema and rendering them coherently.

Rich editorial content:

- Tiptap-style sections are tenant-level integrations.
- Treat page JSON using `type: "tiptap"` as runtime usage examples, and section code as the real source of truth.

Nested routes:

- Files under `src/data/pages/**/*.json` may represent nested slugs.
- Preserve slug/path consistency and do not replace file-based routing with manual lists.

## Decision Rules

Use `alpha` patterns when the task is about:

- tenant DNA
- capability reference
- baseline protocol shape
- proving what the base system already supports

Use `gptgiorgio` patterns when the task is about:

- stronger branded frontend customization
- richer domain-specific sections
- image-heavy schema design
- proving how far customization can go without changing the bootstrap

Do not treat `gptgiorgio` as canonical for legacy admin context awareness.

## Default Operating Procedure

When you receive a JsonPages tenant task:

1. Identify whether the problem belongs to `core`, tenant, or generator.
2. Read the smallest code surface that proves it.
3. Prefer fixing the tenant contract before touching visual polish.
4. Keep generated and deterministic workflows reproducible.
5. State assumptions when inferring intended branded output from examples.

# Migrate Rules and Slash Commands to Skills

Convert Cursor rules ("Applied intelligently") and slash commands to Agent Skills format.

**CRITICAL: Preserve the exact body content. Do not modify, reformat, or "improve" it - copy verbatim.**

## Locations

| Level | Source | Destination |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Project | `{workspaceFolder}/**/.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `{workspaceFolder}/.cursor/commands/*.md` |
| User | `~/.cursor/commands/*.md` |

Notes:
- Cursor rules inside the project can live in nested directories. Be thorough in your search and use glob patterns to find them.
- Ignore anything in ~/.cursor/worktrees
- Ignore anything in ~/.cursor/skills-cursor. This is reserved for Cursor's internal built-in skills and is managed automatically by the system.

## Finding Files to Migrate

**Rules**: Migrate if rule has a `description` but NO `globs` and NO `alwaysApply: true`.

**Commands**: Migrate all - they're plain markdown without frontmatter.

## Conversion Format

### Rules: .mdc → SKILL.md

```markdown
# Before: .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
---
description: What this rule does
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
# Title
Body content...
```

```markdown
# After: .cursor/skills/my-rule/SKILL.md
---
name: my-rule
description: What this rule does
---
# Title
Body content...
```

Changes: Add `name` field, remove `globs`/`alwaysApply`, keep body exactly.

### Commands: .md → SKILL.md

```markdown
# Before: .cursor/commands/commit.md
# Commit current work
Instructions here...
```

```markdown
# After: .cursor/skills/commit/SKILL.md
---
name: commit
description: Commit current work with standardized message format
disable-model-invocation: true
---
# Commit current work
Instructions here...
```

Changes: Add frontmatter with `name` (from filename), `description` (infer from content), and `disable-model-invocation: true`, keep body exactly.

**Note:** The `disable-model-invocation: true` field prevents the model from automatically invoking this skill. Slash commands are designed to be explicitly triggered by the user via the `/` menu, not automatically suggested by the model.

## Notes

- `name` must be lowercase with hyphens only
- `description` is critical for skill discovery
- Optionally delete originals after verifying migration works

### Migrate a Rule (.mdc → SKILL.md)

1. Read the rule file
2. Extract the `description` from the frontmatter
3. Extract the body content (everything after the closing `---` of the frontmatter)
4. Create the skill directory: `.cursor/skills/{skill-name}/` (skill name = filename without .mdc)
5. Write `SKILL.md` with new frontmatter (`name` and `description`) + the EXACT original body content (preserve all whitespace, formatting, code blocks verbatim)
6. Delete the original rule file

### Migrate a Command (.md → SKILL.md)

1. Read the command file
2. Extract description from the first heading (remove `#` prefix)
3. Create the skill directory: `.cursor/skills/{skill-name}/` (skill name = filename without .md)
4. Write `SKILL.md` with new frontmatter (`name`, `description`, and `disable-model-invocation: true`) + blank line + the EXACT original file content (preserve all whitespace, formatting, code blocks verbatim)
5. Delete the original command file

**CRITICAL: Copy the body content character-for-character. Do not reformat, fix typos, or "improve" anything.**

## Workflow

If you have the Task tool available:
DO NOT start to read all of the files yourself. That function should be delegated to the subagents. Your job is to dispatch the subagents for each category of files and wait for the results.

1. [ ] Create the skills directories if they don't exist (`.cursor/skills/` for project, `~/.cursor/skills/` for user)
2. Dispatch three fast general purpose subagents (NOT explore) in parallel to do the following steps for project rules (pattern: `{workspaceFolder}/**/.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), user commands (pattern: `~/.cursor/commands/*.md`), and project commands (pattern: `{workspaceFolder}/**/.cursor/commands/*.md`):
  I. [ ] Find files to migrate in the given pattern
  II. [ ] For rules, check if it's an "applied intelligently" rule (has `description`, no `globs`, no `alwaysApply: true`). Commands are always migrated. DO NOT use the terminal to read files. Use the read tool.
  III. [ ] Make a list of files to migrate. If empty, done.
  IV. [ ] For each file, read it, then write the new skill file preserving the body content EXACTLY. DO NOT use the terminal to write these files. Use the edit tool.
  V. [ ] Delete the original file. DO NOT use the terminal to delete these files. Use the delete tool.
  VI. [ ] Return a list of all the skill files that were migrated along with the original file paths.
3. [ ] Wait for all subagents to complete and summarize the results to the user. IMPORTANT: Make sure to let them know if they want to undo the migration, to ask you to.
4. [ ] If the user asks you to undo the migration, do the opposite of the above steps to restore the original files.


If you don't have the Task tool available:
1. [ ] Create the skills directories if they don't exist (`.cursor/skills/` for project, `~/.cursor/skills/` for user)
2. [ ] Find files to migrate in both project (`.cursor/`) and user (`~/.cursor/`) directories
3. [ ] For rules, check if it's an "applied intelligently" rule (has `description`, no `globs`, no `alwaysApply: true`). Commands are always migrated. DO NOT use the terminal to read files. Use the read tool.
4. [ ] Make a list of files to migrate. If empty, done.
5. [ ] For each file, read it, then write the new skill file preserving the body content EXACTLY. DO NOT use the terminal to write these files. Use the edit tool.
6. [ ] Delete the original file. DO NOT use the terminal to delete these files. Use the delete tool.
7. [ ] Summarize the results to the user. IMPORTANT: Make sure to let them know if they want to undo the migration, to ask you to.
8. [ ] If the user asks you to undo the migration, do the opposite of the above steps to restore the original files.

---

# OlonJS Tenant

Use this skill for work on the OlonJS ecosystem when the task involves:

- a tenant generated from the OlonJS CLI
- `@olonjs/core`
- tenant sections/capsules
- `src/data/pages/**/*.json` or `src/data/config/*.json`
- schema-driven editing and inspector compatibility
- generator scripts that turn a base tenant into a branded tenant

Read code first. Treat documents as secondary unless they help interpret code that is otherwise ambiguous.

## Architecture Specifications 

**Normative:** OlonJS Architecture Specifications **v1.5** (`olonjsSpecs_V_1_5.md`): three-layer CSS theme bridge (engine → `:root` → `@theme`), `ThemeConfig` / appendix A.2.6, path-based Studio selection (`itemPath`), local tokens (`--local-*`), IDAC, TOCC, JSP, TBP, CIP, ECIP, JEB, JAP.

Use this document as the architectural law for each tenant; compliance is judged against it:

- `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\npm-jpcore\specs\olonjsSpecs_V_1_5.md`




## Core Model

OlonJS has a hard split between `core` and `tenant`.

- `@olonjs/core` owns routing, `/admin`, `/admin/preview`, preview stage, studio state, inspector/form factory, and shared engine behavior.
- The tenant owns sections, schemas, type augmentation, page/config JSON, theme/design layer, and local workflow scripts.
- The tenant does not implement the CMS. It implements the tenant protocol consumed by the engine.

In this ecosystem, code is the source of truth.

Compliance priority:

1. Data is bound correctly.
2. Schemas describe fields correctly.
3. Content is editable without breaking the inspector.
4. Tenant structure stays standardized.
5. Context-aware focus/highlight in the legacy admin is desirable but secondary.

## Canonical References

Use these local references when available:

- Base tenant DNA: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\temp\alpha`
- Custom tenant reference: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\temp\gptgiorgio`
- Core engine: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\npm-jpcore\packages\core`
- Generator example: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dev\temp\clonark\generate_olon.sh`

If these paths are missing, infer the same roles from the current workspace:

- base CLI-generated tenant
- branded tenant
- core package
- generator script

## Tenant Anatomy

Expect these files to move together:

- `src/components/<section>/View.tsx`
- `src/components/<section>/schema.ts`
- `src/components/<section>/types.ts`
- `src/components/<section>/index.ts`
- `src/lib/ComponentRegistry.tsx`
- `src/lib/schemas.ts`
- `src/lib/addSectionConfig.ts`
- `src/types.ts`
- `src/data/pages/**/*.json`
- `src/data/config/site.json`
- `src/data/config/theme.json`
- `src/data/config/menu.json`

Useful rule: if a section type changes, check all of the files above before concluding the task is done.

## What Good Work Looks Like

A good tenant change:

- stays inside tenant boundaries unless the issue is truly in `@olonjs/core`
- keeps schema, defaults, registry, and type augmentation aligned
- preserves editability for strings, lists, nested objects, CTAs, and image fields
- uses `ImageSelectionSchema`-style image fields when the content is image-driven
- keeps page content JSON-first

A suspicious tenant change:

- patches the core to fix a tenant modeling problem
- adds visual complexity without data bindings
- introduces fields into JSON that are not represented in schema
- changes a section view without updating defaults or types
- optimizes legacy context awareness at the expense of simpler, reliable editability

## Workflow 1: Base Tenant -> Branded Tenant

This is the primary workflow.

Goal:

- transform a CLI-generated base tenant into a branded tenant through a single generator script

Treat the generator script as procedural source of truth for the green build workflow.

When maintaining or authoring a generator:

1. Separate non-deterministic bootstrap from deterministic sync.
2. Make explicit which files are managed output.
3. Keep the script aligned with the current tenant code, not with stale docs.
4. Preserve tenant protocol files: sections, schemas, registries, type augmentation, config JSON, assets, shims.
5. Prefer deterministic local writes after any remote/bootstrap step.

Typical structure of a good generator:

- preflight checks
- remote/bootstrap steps such as `shadcn` or external registries
- deterministic creation/sync of tenant files
- compatibility patches for known unstable upstream payloads
- final validation commands

When asked to update a branded tenant generator:

1. Diff base tenant against branded tenant.
2. Classify differences into:
   - intended branded output
   - reusable generator logic
   - accidental drift
3. Encode only the reusable intended differences into the script.
4. Keep the output reproducible from a fresh base tenant.

## Workflow 2: Add Or Change A Section

When adding a new section type:

1. Create `View.tsx`, `schema.ts`, `types.ts`, `index.ts`.
2. Register the section in `src/lib/ComponentRegistry.tsx`.
3. Register the schema in `src/lib/schemas.ts`.
4. Add defaults and label in `src/lib/addSectionConfig.ts`.
5. Extend `SectionComponentPropsMap` and module augmentation in `src/types.ts`.
6. Add or update page JSON using the new section type.

When changing an existing section:

1. Read the section schema first.
2. Read the page JSON using it.
3. Check the view for `data-jp-field` usage and binding shape.
4. Update defaults if the data shape changed.
5. Verify the inspector still has a path to edit the content.

## Workflow 3: Images, Rich Content, Nested Routes

Images:

- Prefer structured image objects compatible with tenant base schemas.
- Assume the core supports image picking and upload flows.
- The tenant is responsible for declaring image fields in schema and rendering them coherently.

Rich editorial content:

- Tiptap-style sections are tenant-level integrations.
- Treat page JSON using `type: "tiptap"` as runtime usage examples, and section code as the real source of truth.

Nested routes:

- Files under `src/data/pages/**/*.json` may represent nested slugs.
- Preserve slug/path consistency and do not replace file-based routing with manual lists.

## Decision Rules

Use `alpha` patterns when the task is about:

- tenant DNA
- capability reference
- baseline protocol shape
- proving what the base system already supports

Use `gptgiorgio` patterns when the task is about:

- stronger branded frontend customization
- richer domain-specific sections
- image-heavy schema design
- proving how far customization can go without changing the bootstrap

Do not treat `gptgiorgio` as canonical for legacy admin context awareness.

2. Read the smallest code surface that proves it.

---
# Run Shell Commands

Use this skill only when the user explicitly invokes `/shell`.

## Behavior

1. Treat all user text after the `/shell` invocation as the literal shell command to run.
2. Execute that command immediately with the terminal tool.
3. Do not rewrite, explain, or "improve" the command before running it.
4. Do not inspect the repository first unless the command itself requires repository context.
5. If the user invokes `/shell` without any following text, ask them which command to run.

## Response

- Run the command first.
- Then briefly report the exit status and any important stdout or stderr.

# Updating Cursor Settings

This skill guides you through modifying Cursor/VSCode user settings. Use this when you want to change editor settings, preferences, configuration, themes, keybindings, or any `settings.json` values.

## Settings File Location

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| macOS | ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json |
| Linux | ~/.config/Cursor/User/settings.json |
| Windows | %APPDATA%\Cursor\User\settings.json |

## Before Modifying Settings

1. **Read the existing settings file** to understand current configuration
2. **Preserve existing settings** - only add/modify what the user requested
3. **Validate JSON syntax** before writing to avoid breaking the editor

## Modifying Settings

### Step 1: Read Current Settings

```typescript
// Read the settings file first
const settingsPath = "~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json";
// Use the Read tool to get current contents
```

### Step 2: Identify the Setting to Change

Common setting categories:
- **Editor**: `editor.fontSize`, `editor.tabSize`, `editor.wordWrap`, `editor.formatOnSave`
- **Workbench**: `workbench.colorTheme`, `workbench.iconTheme`, `workbench.sideBar.location`
- **Files**: `files.autoSave`, `files.exclude`, `files.associations`
- **Terminal**: `terminal.integrated.fontSize`, `terminal.integrated.shell.*`
- **Cursor-specific**: Settings prefixed with `cursor.` or `aipopup.`

### Step 3: Update the Setting

When modifying settings.json:
1. Parse the existing JSON (handle comments - VSCode settings support JSON with comments)
2. Add or update the requested setting
3. Preserve all other existing settings
4. Write back with proper formatting (2-space indentation)

### Example: Changing Font Size

If user says "make the font bigger":

```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 16
}
```

### Example: Enabling Format on Save

If user says "format my code when I save":

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

### Example: Changing Theme

If user says "use dark theme" or "change my theme":

```json
{
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark Modern"
}
```

## Important Notes

1. **JSON with Comments**: VSCode/Cursor settings.json supports comments (`//` and `/* */`). When reading, be aware comments may exist. When writing, preserve comments if possible.

2. **Restart May Be Required**: Some settings take effect immediately, others require reloading the window or restarting Cursor. Inform the user if a restart is needed.

3. **Backup**: For significant changes, consider mentioning the user can undo via Ctrl/Cmd+Z in the settings file or by reverting git changes if tracked.

4. **Workspace vs User Settings**:
   - User settings (what this skill covers): Apply globally to all projects
   - Workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`): Apply only to the current project

5. **Commit Attribution**: When the user asks about commit attribution, clarify whether they want to edit the **CLI agent** or the **IDE agent**. For the CLI agent, modify `~/.cursor/cli-config.json`. For the IDE agent, it is controlled from the UI at **Cursor Settings > Agent > Attribution** (not settings.json).

## Common User Requests → Settings

| User Request | Setting |
|--------------|---------|
| "bigger/smaller font" | `editor.fontSize` |
| "change tab size" | `editor.tabSize` |
| "format on save" | `editor.formatOnSave` |
| "word wrap" | `editor.wordWrap` |
| "change theme" | `workbench.colorTheme` |
| "hide minimap" | `editor.minimap.enabled` |
| "auto save" | `files.autoSave` |
| "line numbers" | `editor.lineNumbers` |
| "bracket matching" | `editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled` |
| "cursor style" | `editor.cursorStyle` |
| "smooth scrolling" | `editor.smoothScrolling` |

## Workflow

1. Read ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json
2. Parse the JSON content
3. Add/modify the requested setting(s)
4. Write the updated JSON back to the file
5. Inform the user the setting has been changed and whether a reload is needed

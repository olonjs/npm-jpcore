# Architecture Decision Records

This folder captures the *why* behind significant technical decisions in `npm-jpcore` (the OlonJS monorepo). Code shows *what* was built; ADRs explain *why it was built this way* and *what alternatives were considered*.

ADRs are the highest-signal documentation we can leave for future humans and agents working on this codebase.

## When to write an ADR

Write one when:

- Designing or changing a public API of `@olonjs/core` (contracts, manifests, config shape).
- Choosing between competing architectural approaches with meaningful trade-offs.
- Introducing a tenant-facing convention that downstream repos must follow.
- Adding or deprecating a framework, library, or major dependency.
- Making any decision that would be expensive to reverse.

Do **not** write one for trivial refactors, cosmetic changes, or prototypes.

## Conventions

- Filename: `ADR-NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` (4-digit zero-padded, sequential, never renumbered).
- Store in this folder. No subfolders.
- One decision per ADR. If a change bundles several decisions, split them.
- Status lifecycle: `Proposed` → `Accepted` → (`Superseded by ADR-NNNN` | `Deprecated`). Qualifiers are allowed when useful (e.g. `Proposed — pending implementation and verification`).
- **Never delete** an old ADR. When a decision changes, add a new ADR that supersedes it and update the old one's `Status` line only.
- Write in English. Present tense for the decision, past tense for context.

## Template

Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md) when starting a new ADR. The minimum sections are:

1. **Status** — one of the values above, plus a date.
2. **Context** — what forces are at play, what constraints, what problem.
3. **Decision** — the chosen approach, stated as a commitment.
4. **Alternatives Considered** — what else we looked at and why we rejected it.
5. **Consequences** — what becomes easier, harder, or required as a result.

Optional: `Follow-ups`, `Open Points`, `Compliance mapping`, `Risk mitigation`, `References`.

## For agents

When you are about to make an architectural decision in this repo:

1. Read the index above. If a relevant ADR exists, honor it (or explicitly supersede it with a new one — never silently contradict).
2. If none exists and the decision qualifies, draft a new ADR **before** writing implementation code. The ADR is the first test of whether the design holds up.
3. Do not move an ADR from `Proposed` to `Accepted` without explicit user confirmation.
